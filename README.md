## Tests related

Both endpoints have been checked according to specification https://favqs.com/api

The next checks have not been implemented:

- Pivate filter for list quotes endpoint has not been checked as it requires pro user session to be applied
- Unfav error with message "Private quotes cannot be unfav'd." has not been cheked cause:
	- it is not possible to find exiting private quote across first 100 pages
	- it requires pro session to update quote to private
	
Known issues are:

	- Hidden filter doesn't return any quote in response but all other requests returns "No quote found" assume it as bug
	- Endpoint PUT /api/quotes/:quote_id/fav with invalid quote_id returns an error model that doesn't meet requirmets assume it as bug
